               <h2   style="text-align: center;">How To Set Up The Chess Board</h2>
               <p> First, it’s important to know how to set up the board so you can play. </p>
               <img src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/start-chess-game_3c618.jpg">
                <p>
                    The setup of pieces is very important. The major pieces (rook and queen), minor pieces (bishop and
                    knight), and the king are all on the last row of a chess board.

                    The rooks occupy the corner squares. Next to the rook is a knight. The bishop takes the other square
                    next to the knight. The queen is always placed on her color (white queen on white square), and the
                    king is placed next to her.

                    Your eight pawns occupy the next row all in a straight line. Your opponent’s pieces reflect the same
                    positions as yours, including the queen that occupies a square that matches her color.

                    To start a game, White always moves first.

                    Any pawn may move but the strongest initial moves by pawns are by the middle ones to control the
                    center of the board. In addition, a knight may move. Because the other pieces are blocked by the
                    line of pawns, they may not move yet. Before we discuss opening moves more, let’s get to know each
                    piece and how it moves.

               <h2  style="text-align: center;">How The Chess Pieces Move</h2>
               <p>Learning the chess pieces is very important. Let’s see how each one moves, too:</p>
               <div>
                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">The King</h3>
                   <p>
                       The king is the most important piece because you lose the game when he is attacked and can't get
                       to safety. This is called checkmate, and it is how a game is decided
                   </p>
                   
                   <figure>
                       <img src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/chess-king_4a271.jpg">
                       <figcaption>The King can move just one square at a time.</figcaption>
                   </figure>
                   <p>
                       When your king is threatened by being placed in check, you must remove the threat. A king can
                       move one square in any direction (except it moves two squares when castling, which is discussed
                       as a special move below), but it cannot move into check or next to the enemy king. It can capture
                       any enemy piece except the king. Because of its weakness, the king rarely plays an active role
                       until the endgame.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <div>
                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">The Queen</h3>
                   <p>
                       The queen is the most powerful piece because it can move in any straight-line direction:
                       vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. It also can move any number of squares.
                   </p>
                   <figure>
                       <img src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/Chess-queen_c5f1e.jpg">
                        <figcaption>The queen can control 27 squares from the center.</figcaption>
                   </figure>
                   <p>Although you start with only one queen, you may gain another one when a pawn promotes (see special
                       moves below). Because the queen is slightly stronger than a rook and bishop together, exchanging
                       the queen for a single piece other than the enemy queen is usually not a good idea.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">The Rook</h3>
                   <p>
                       You have two rooks; each one starts on a corner square. It may move vertically or horizontally
                       through any unoccupied square.
                   </p>
                   <figure>
                       <img src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/chess-rook_48110.jpg">
                       <figcaption>The rook controls 14 squares from the center.</figcaption>
                   </figure>
                   <p>
                       It participates with the king in a special move called castling. A major piece, the rook is
                       stronger than a bishop or knight. Rooks are very powerful in the endgame when they can control
                       many squares and move without being blocked by pawns.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <div>
                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">The Bishop</h3>
                   <p>
                       You also start with two bishops, one on a light square and one on a dark square. Like a rook, a
                       bishop may move through any unoccupied square, but each one moves only diagonally.
                   </p>
                   <figure>
                       <img src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/chess-bishops_dfe1f.jpg">
                        <figcaption>The bishop controls 13 squares from the center.</figcaption>
                   </figure>
                   <p>
                       Because it always stays on the same color, it has access to only half of the squares on the
                       board.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <div>
                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">The Knight </h3>
                   <p>
                       Unlike other pieces, the knight moves in two directions at once. This tricky piece moves in an
                       "L"-shaped pattern (two squares in one direction and then one square in a different direction).
                   </p>
                   <figure>
                       <img
                           src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/chess-knights_15983.jpg">
                           <figcaption>From its square, the knight can control up to eight squares.</figcaption>
                   </figure>
                   <p>
                       In the center of the board, it can dangerously attack many squares and is well-suited for a
                       tactic known as a fork. Although a minor piece, the knight is useful in “closed” games when many
                       pieces clutter the board because it alone has the special ability to jump over any piece.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <div>
                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">The Pawn</h3>
                   <p>
                       Each player begins with eight pawns, each one in a line in front of the other pieces.
                   </p>
                   <figure>
                        <img src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/WeirdAuthor/chess-pawns_2faee.jpg">
                        <figcaption>The game starts with 16 pawns, eight white and eight black. </figcaption>
                   </figure>
                   <p>
                       Until a pawn advances across the board to the final rank when it can be promoted, it is the
                       weakest piece in most situations, but it can be valuable to block enemy pieces. Unlike other
                       pieces, a pawn moves only forward unless it is capturing an enemy piece, which it does by moving
                       diagonally one square to the left or right. It moves only one square except on its first move
                       when it may move one or two squares forward. A surprising move of the pawn is the en passant
                       capture (described in special moves below).

                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">Checkmate</h3>
                   <p>
                       A game is won when one player can checkmate the other. Checkmate occurs when a player who is next
                       to move is in check and cannot move the king out of check.

                       <b style="font-weight: bold;">Game over!</b> wink A game may also end when a player resigns. resign Although we want to win,
                       playing a game with a hopeless position is frustrating and discouraging. When you become
                       experienced, it’s best to resign and start a new game in that situation, but in your first few
                       years of playing, you should play it out as your opponent might not know how to win, or may make
                       a big mistake.

                   <h3  style="text-align: center;">Draw</h3>
                   <p>
                       Games do not always end with a win or a loss. They may also end in a draw (a tie), which is the
                       result of neither player winning. Both players can agree to a draw, and a draw also results when
                       a stalemate—a player on the next turn cannot make a legal move and is not in check—occurs.

                       A draw also occurs when neither player has sufficient pieces to checkmate an opponent, or when an
                       event known as threefold repetition occurs (the same position occurs three times with the same
                       player to move), or when the 50-move rule is met (the last 50 moves by each player doesn’t result
                       in a capture or a pawn move).
